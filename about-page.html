          <!-- About SarCor -->
          <p>
            The name SarCor is derived from Sakhokuhle, my second name, with a
            meaning: "building something beautiful". I was born and raised in
            Kwazulu Natal, Durban, a very diverse city full of dreamers like me.
            SarCor is a young man full of dreams and plans to make his dreams a
            reality, not only dreaming but living the dream.
          </p>

          <p>
            We chase different dreams or goals and make decisions that are
            life-changing each time, but no mind grows in the dark or inside the
            box. Leave your box and go outside, see the world, and do something
            you thought you couldn't do.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I had lost hope and was struck by depression, I looked down and
            saw my hands. I saw an opportunity and hidden talent, and I started
            drawing. Looking for things to draw online, I came across an
            application at <a href="https://www.nemisa.co.za">NEMISA</a> for
            animation students. I applied with doubts, but I got it, and there
            my goal changed from being an animator to being a developer. I am
            keen to learn and develop websites.
