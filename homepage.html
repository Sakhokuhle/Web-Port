      <p>
        The name SarCor is derived from Sakhokuhle, my second name, with a
        meaning: "building something beautiful". I was born and raised in
        Kwazulu Natal, Durban, a very diverse city full of dreamers like me.
        Saikko is a young man full of dreams and plans to make his dreams a
        reality, not only dreaming but living the dream.
